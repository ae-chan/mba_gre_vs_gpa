Note: I didn't get a call or a zoom invitation from the admissions, so I thought it was a ding. But I get the email today saying I get admitted! No scholarship from Haas. I have received the Dean's Impact Scholarship from Ross (full-tuition scholarship + additional 10K living stipend for two years), Batten scholarship from Darden (full-tuition scholarship), and 80K scholarship from Anderson. Still waiting for results from other schools. Is there any chance I can negotiate for scholarship/financial aid from Haas? Hope to get some advice here. Many thanks!!

Note: R1 FE, interviewed in early Feb, waitlist in early April. Thrilling ending to a very lengthy process, and my top choice. Thanks to this forum for the context and guidance.
For those interested, I did the following after my waitlist notification:
1. Sent four additional LORs (one current CBS student, one CBS grad, 2 colleagues). They emailed them directly.
2. Went to an admissions event (I live in NYC so it's easy).
3. Emailed admissions mid-May to notify them of another offer I received and asked for a decision soon if possible (professionally, of course).

The final component of my b-school application process is my Wharton TBD on Wednesday. My fingers are crossed for a Wharton acceptance, but either way, I feel incredibly fortunate to attend CBS in the fall. Wishing all of you the best of luck throughout this process!

Note: Received the call today right before noon EST from a Cambridge number. Was quite shaky and surprised since it was a week earlier than the school's announced decision deadline. To give clarity for other waitlisted students, I submitted 3 letters total: 1 from a former manager who completed her MBA in Cambridge (so I went for the why Boston angle), 1 from an alum, 1 from myself outlining a professional update + reasons why Sloan + how it all ties to what I can do for Sloan and what it can do for me. I believe these letters were absolutely crucial to convert the waitlist over to an acceptance. I did not visit campus nor did I attend virtual events.

Note: Wow!! Somebody pinch me, because I must be dreaming. I am beyond excited to join the Haas community in the fall. The MBA application process has been an emotional marathon. For those on the waitlist, I feel for you. It's an uneasy feeling, but absolutely worth it!
My waitlist strategy included: retaking the GRE to improve my quant score, submitting an updated resume to speak to a promotion, submitting another letter of recommendation, submitting a clarified career statement including why Haas was best for meet my goals, and talking to more students.
Good luck everyone. I truly believe things work out the way they are meant to.

Note: IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL THEY SAY IT'S OVER ... Rejection is sometimes GOD's RE-DIRECTION. 8 months ago, I decided to apply for Business School and went for Stanford GSB Round 2 (the only school I applied to). Although I have always been smitten by the Excellence of the Mighty Berkeley College of Engineering, it was not until March 2023 that I checked Berkeley Haas for the first time, just by curiosity and I couldn't believe how EXCELLENT Haas was for Technology Entrepreneurship, way better that Stanford GSB for my Post-MBA goals. So, I applied for Haas MBA Round 3 a few hours before their deadline and it was the BEST Decision of my Life. Ultimately, I ended up being rejected by GSB but it felt sweet because Haas was everything I wanted and I got in. An advice, for any MBA applicant: Don't follow the hype and the school prestige; Go with the Business School that most fits your Post-MBA goals and you won't regret it.

Note: I'm overwhelmed with happiness -- received the call this AM. A huge thanks to this forum that helped guide me throughout the process + navigating the waitlist. Looking forward to meeting everyone this Fall!
For those still on the waitlist, here's what I did:
*Attended on-campus club events specific to my interest (if open to the public and possible)
*Received two letters of endorsement from current CBS students
*Received an additional professional letter of recommendation from a former boss
*Engaged with CBS alums -- even if you don't have a letter to share, it's meaningful to put in the portal updates
*Visited on-campus for an info session so I could get facetime w/ an AdCom member
*Checked-in via email every few weeks
*Communicated all of the above via portal updates so it was formally in my app file

Note: I know navigating the Waitlist process is quite daunting, so I figured I'd offer some tips for those who've also been dealt the WL hand. My background includes four years of M&A Consulting experience at B4 and various extracurriculars before applying. I took the following steps (in order of importance):
1. Continue to show interest in the program: I did an official school visit and connected with current students, which included meeting with one person who was waitlisted during last year's app cycle
2. Updated Work Experience: I was promoted after I found out I was waitlisted, so I not only provided admissions an update on the promotion decision but also provided them an updated resume with new work experience and my additional responsibilites now that I was promoted
3. Retaking the GRE: I acutally found out I was accepted the day before I was scheduled to retake the GRE, but I'm still going to take it because I was also WL at Booth and want to give them an updated score. I also have a vendetta against the GRE, so I'm eager to crack a 322+.
Note: I don't mean to undermine the merits of my application, but my acceptance from the waitlist also seems a bit circumstantial given the spotlight that CBS has been under due to the Gaza protest. I'd imagine this negative image has detered some folks from going attending CBS, and thus opened the door for WL applicants

ORM; 7 years government WE, including COVID-19 response this past year; non-traditional applicant, am very likely an outlier by at least one category, and not in a necessarily positive way.
Verbal diarrhea incoming: I have a revived faith in the Lord. Rejected from LBS, Tuck, Yale, Darden. Wait-listed at Ross after the tortuous wait Mon-Wed this week, and wait-listed today at Fuqua after the slow bleed from morning til the afternoon portal notification. Haas AdCom -- the same person I awkwardly talked to at an in-person event in 2019 pre-pandemic -- calls a week before formal notification?? Receiving the CGSM Fellowship, ranked Haas #1. What a roller-coaster week, especially the past 10 hours. Good luck and best wishes, all!

Note: I can't believe my eyes!!! Had my interview by 12 noon today and got admission letter on portal by 10:45pm the same today! Interviewer just wanted to make sure I was personable and a team player not just book smart. He asked questions like what will you contribute to the school apart from joining clubs and he was pleased with my answer to throw karaoke and parties for bonding with classmates. Lol. Mehn! It's been a ride! Applied on the 11th of January 2023, the last day for merit fellowship. I had lost all hope of an interview even because of my low GRE score even though my gpa is high at 3.81/4.0.
I have one question however, the decision letter doesn't mention anything about scholarships. Please is there a separate application for scholarships? I'm not sure what this means. Overall I'm excited and grateful and I wish all who are awaiting decisions from all schools the best of luck! You're genuinely in my prayers.

Note: ORM - Chinese. Very shocked to have gotten in but a few admission consultants told me to apply anyway . I took the test 6 times and couldn’t improve much. believe that if you are a kind person - one that never judges and one that helps THOSE around you be successful then realize that test score is just one of many criteria’s. Shoot your shot. Forget what people say. Know your strengths. Focus on your passions not just test taking.

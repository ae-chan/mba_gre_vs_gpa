Was quite shaky and surprised since it was a week earlier than the school's announced decision deadline.

Rejection is sometimes GOD's RE-DIRECTION. 8 months ago, I decided to apply for Business School and went for Stanford GSB Round 2 (the only school I applied to). Although I have always been smitten by the Excellence of the Mighty Berkeley College of Engineering, it was not until March 2023 that I checked Berkeley Haas for the first time, just by curiosity and I couldn't believe how EXCELLENT Haas was for Technology Entrepreneurship, way better that Stanford GSB for my Post-MBA goals. So, I applied for Haas MBA Round 3 a few hours before their deadline and it was the BEST Decision of my Life. Ultimately, I ended up being rejected by GSB but it felt sweet because Haas was everything I wanted and I got in. An advice, for any MBA applicant: Don't follow the hype and the school prestige; Go with the Business School that most fits your Post-MBA goals and you won't regret it."
